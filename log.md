# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: Thursday, April 27, 2023

**Today's Progress**: Solved 5 strings problems in C from Saylor Academy unit 2; revised some topics in C++.

**Thoughts**: I really struggled with strings, but, overall, I feel like I am slowly getting better at it. C++ is still new for me, but I managed to figure out some basic functionality. I'm very excited to get back into the coding again.
