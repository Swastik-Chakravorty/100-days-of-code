# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: Saturday, June 17, 2023

**Today's Progress**: Solved 2 recursion problems in C++

**Thoughts**: I'm struggling with recursion, Today I learned about tail recursion and head recursion. I'm very excited to get back into coding again. I also started 100 days of self improvement challenge from today.
