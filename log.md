# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: Thursday, April 27, 2023

**Today's Progress**: Solved 5 strings problems in C from Saylor Academy unit 2; revised some topics in C++.

**Thoughts**: I really struggled with strings, but overall, I feel like I am slowly getting better at it. C++ is still new for me, but I managed to figure out some basic functionality. I'm very excited to get back into the coding again.

### Day 1: Friday, April 28, 2023

**Today's Progress**: Solved 10 Patterns problems in C++.

**Thoughts**: Started many challenges parallelly like walking, journaling, drinking water minimum 3 Ltrs, meditation, yoga, reading book. I started reading Atomic Habits book. After completed the first chapter I learned, process is much more important than result. I really enjoyed my day, especially coding.

### Day 2: Saturday, April 29, 2023

**Today's Progress**: Solved 5 Function problems in C++.

**Thoughts**: Well could do 4.64 Kms walking, journaling, drank 3 Ltrs of water, 3 minitues of meditation, 10 minitues of yoga, read few pages (from Chapter 2) of Atomic Habits book. From today onwards I decided to build programmer's mindset. I really enjoyed the day with coding.

### Day 3: Sunday, April 30, 2023

**Today's Progress**: Solved 8 Function problems in C++.

**Thoughts**: Well, today I couldn't do anything extra productive. But one thing I realised is that I didn't procrastinate coding today; in fact, I enjoyed coding today in a holiday mood. I really love programming. I learned one thing today: "Every moment of life is important", so live every moment to the fullest.

### Day 4: Monday, May 1, 2023

**Today's Progress**: Finished week 3 of CS50 and solved 3 problems.

**Thoughts**: Well, today also I could not do anything extra productive, only walked 5 Kms. I realised today that my time management is poor. So, I have to work on my time management.

### Day 10: Sunday, May 7, 2023

**Today's Progress**: Spent a full day solving the Fastest Horse puzzle with C++.

**Thoughts**: Well, today I could do journaling, 3 minitues of meditation, weist-shoulder exercise, 5 minitues pranayam, drank more than 3 Ltrs water. But couldn't read book, couldn't go for walking. Today, I realized, I need to put in extra time and effort to see results promptly and create habits that last.

### Day 12: Tuesday, May 9, 2023

**Today's Progress**: Solved 4 arrays problems which were asked by Google, Amazon and Oracle in C++

**Thoughts**: Well, today I could do journaling, drank more than 3 Ltrs water and finished 3rd chapter of "Atomic Habits" book. Get to know a little bit about "4 Laws of behavior change". But couldn't do 3 minitues of meditation, weist-shoulder exercise, 5 minitues pranayam, couldn't go for walking. Today, I realized, I'm building a bad habit of "doing nothing extra productive" for 5 days in a row. I'll break it and make a good habit instead of it very soon.

### DAY OFF: Wednesday, May 10, 2023

**Today's Progress**: Today, I'm not going to count the days. Despite studying C++ (revision and the basics of pointers) and performing some practice today, I'm not counting it as a coding day because my total time spent practicing was less than an hour.

**Thoughts**: Well, today I couldn't do anything. But, I came to understand that sometimes taking a day off is preferable. I spent an entire day studying coding, but I only put what I learned into practise for an hour. Therefore, I'm not counting the day.

**Thoughts**: Well, today I could do journaling, drank more than 3 Ltrs water.
